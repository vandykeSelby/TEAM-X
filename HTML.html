    <h1 class="title">INTERVIEW QUESTIONS</h1>
    <h4>These are 3 of the most asked questions in any job interview</h4>

    <div class="questions">

    





<section id="q1">

        <h2>Question 1: Tell me about yourself</h2>

        <p>This question is usually asked at the beginning of the interview and is a way for the interviewer to get to know you better.<br> It's important to keep your answer professional and relevant to the job you're applying for.</br>

             You should mention your relevant work experience, education, and skills.</p>

        <p>Example answer: "I graduated with a degree in Business Administration and have been working in the marketing field 

            for the past 5 years.

             My previous experience includes<br> managing social media accounts, creating marketing campaigns, and analyzing data. I'm passionate about creating effective marketing strategies and am excited about the opportunity </br>to apply my skills at your company."</p>

</section>

<section id="q2">

        <h2>Question 2: What are your strengths and weaknesses?</h2>

        <p>This question is designed to assess your self-awareness and ability to improve. When discussing your strengths, focus on the ones that are most relevant to the job.<br> When discussing your weaknesses, be honest but also explain how you are working to improve them.</br></p>

        <p>Example answer: "One of my strengths is my ability to work well in a team. I enjoy collaborating with others and am able to communicate effectively.<br> As for weaknesses, I sometimes struggle with time management. However, I've been working on implementing a daily schedule to help me better manage my time."</br></p>

</section>

<section id="q3">

        <h2>Question 3: Why do you want to work for this company?</h2>

        <p>This question shows the interviewer if you've done your research on the company and if you're a good fit for their culture.<br> Before the interview, make sure to research the company's values, mission, and any recent news or projects.</br></p>

        <p>Example answer: "I'm excited about the opportunity to work for a company that values innovation and teamwork. Your recent project in sustainability<br> aligns with my personal values and I'm impressed with your commitment to making a positive impact in the world. I also appreciate the emphasis</br> on professional development and growth within the company."</p>

        <ul>

            <li>Customize your CV or resume to the job you're applying for: Tailor your CV or resume to the specific job you are applying for. Use keywords from the job description and highlight relevant experience and skills that match the job requirements.</li>

            <li>Keep it concise: Your CV or resume should be no longer than two pages. Keep the content relevant and to the point, and use bullet points to break up large blocks of text.</li>

            <li>Use a clear and professional format: Use a clear and professional font such as Arial or Times New Roman, and use a font size between 10 and 12 points. Use headings and subheadings to organize your content and make it easy to read.</li>

            <li>Highlight your achievements: Use specific examples of your achievements and successes to demonstrate your skills and abilities. Quantify your achievements whenever possible, using numbers and percentages to show the impact you've had in previous roles.</li>

            <li>Focus on results: Employers are interested in what you can do for them, so focus on the results you've achieved in previous roles. Highlight your contributions to your previous employers and how you've helped to achieve their goals.</li>

            <li>Be honest: Don't exaggerate your skills or experience on your CV or resume. Be honest about what you can do and what you have achieved, as employers will check your references and verify your claims.</li>

            <li>Check for errors: Proofread your CV or resume carefully to ensure that there are no errors or typos. Ask a friend or colleague to review it for you, as a fresh pair of eyes can often spot mistakes that you might have missed.</li>

            <li>Include relevant education and training: List your educational qualifications and any relevant training or certifications you have received. This can help demonstrate your expertise and commitment to your field.</li>
